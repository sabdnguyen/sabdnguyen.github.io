        Hi I'm Sabrina Diem Mi Nguyen. I am a 3rd year general pre-engineering and liberal arts
        student at Saint Mary's College of California. This fall, I will be transferring
        to Washington University in St. Louis to study Mechanical Engineering. My goal is
        to use engineering and liberal arts education to make an impact at the intersection between
        art, service, and science to find solutions to structural issues that enable inequality.
        <br /> <br />
        On my page, you will find some projects I have been working on and some goals I have
        during my undergrad career and beyond.
